# luciddreamersjournal
A Sinatra Web Application that will allow users to log their dreams and allow for more lucid dreams.

This will be an application that will allows users to log in and create journal
entries of the nights previous dreams, also a feature to edit, delete, or create
new entries will be allowed.

Resources page will show a few tips and tricks on how to become lucid in your dreams,
(Able to influence the events of your dreams, or some say control your dreams).

Users should be able to read over all journal entries and choose to edit, or
delete any dream entries.

Not quite sure how I want this app to interact between users, obviously users
should only be able to edit, and delete their own entries, but maybe they can
read other users entries and leave comments? Possible addition.
